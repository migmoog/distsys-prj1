The peer system algorithm functions like so:

1. Process flags for specified files
 - check for error in passing the flags and making sure
 the file exists

2. Open the hostsfile and parse into string vector (svec_t in svec.c)

3. print names of peers for sureness sake

4. open socket and bind it for the process to listen to its peers

5. sleep() for 5 seconds to allow other processes on the network to begin

6. surf through list of peers and open corresponding sockets to send "I am alive" messages

7. once sent, listen for said messages

8. after recvfrom() blocks conclude, print "READY" to stderr

9. cleanup allocated addrinfo's, and close all opened file descriptors
